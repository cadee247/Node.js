//  4.1 What does a web server receive from the client, and what does it send
//  back?

//  answer The web server receives requests from the client and sends back responses.


//  4.2 Why should you use const instead of var to store the HTTP server in your
//  application?

//  answer Because your server will continue to listen for communication from clients, it’s
//  important not to reassign the variable representing the server. In ES6, it has become convention to
//  mark these objects as constants, not reassignable variables.


//  When you navigate to http://localhost:3000/ while your server is running,
//  what type of HTTP request are you making?

//  answer Nearly every request you can expect to make at this stage in the application’s devel
//  opment, including a request to http://localhost:300/, is an HTTP GET request.
